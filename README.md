## Garmin Connect IQ datafiled for counting steps during activities

Please visit the [Garmin Connect IQ](https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/eb7018d6-3a13-4530-92ec-ed51d1f56e07#0) application store to download the datafield. 

### Description
This datafield is an extension of the "Steps to FIT" datafield. The only difference between the two is that this datafield uses a multiplier to correct the number of steps measured by the device. The multiplier can be configured through the Connect IQ phone application or the Garmin Express PC software. 
It can be useful if you use trekking poles and would like to correct the measured step count. 

For some devices (e.g., Fenix 3 and Fenix 3 HR) the steps data may not appear on the Garmin Connect website and in the application. This is a known bug of the Garmin Connect ecosystem, and hopefully it will be fixed soon. 

The original datafield without the multiplier can be downloaded from this location: [Steps to FIT](https://apps.garmin.com/hu-HU/apps/eb7018d6-3a13-4530-92ec-ed51d1f56e07#0)
